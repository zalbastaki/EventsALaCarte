story: >-
  Every time Rima had gatherings at home, she spent weeks planning and made sure
  everything was set to perfection. Her hard work was always recognized by
  guests that praised how great everything looked. Her home gatherings started
  long before the dream of Events À La Carte, and planning events was always a
  joy and one of her hobbies.


  When Rima and her family first came to Bahrain, she joined the Riffa Views
  Homeowner Association and was in charge of the events planning. After her
  first event, everyone remarked that the event was so spectacular, it couldn’t
  possibly be her first. Following that great success, she planned many events
  with the Riffa Views Homeowner Association, each new event receiving more
  praise and awe than the one before.


  Rima always wanted a business of her own, and now that she’d found her
  passion, Events À La Carte was born. With each success of Events À La Carte
  came more motivation to work harder and plan more. As Events À La Carte grew,
  so did the desire to plan beautiful events for her wonderful clients.
